This week we batter the listeners up with five barrels of feedback, mourn the Great Waite Park Tragedy, discuss the concept of novelty in a not boring way, Charlie finally got the movie pass and used it, we enter the magical wonderland inside Dan's head to discuss his idiosyncratic fall traditions, and Charlie goes to Boston! How you like them apples?
